## Ways to contribute

- **Bug reports** — open an issue using the Bug Report template
- **Feature requests** — open an issue using the Feature Request template
- **Code contributions** — fork the repo, make your changes, and open a pull request
- **Documentation improvements** — fix typos, clarify explanations, add examples
- **Security disclosures** — see [SECURITY.md](SECURITY.md)

---

## Reporting bugs

Use the **Bug Report** issue template. Include:

- Home Assistant version and platform (e.g. Home Assistant OS 12.x on Raspberry Pi 4)
- Integration version (from Settings → Devices & Services)
- A clear description of what happened versus what you expected
- Relevant log output (Settings → System → Logs, filter for `ute_tarifas`)
- Steps to reproduce

---

## Requesting features

Use the **Feature Request** issue template. Describe:

- The problem you are trying to solve
- The behavior you would like to see
- Any alternatives you have considered

Before opening a request, check the [development guide](docs/documentation/04-development-guide.md) and existing issues to avoid duplicates.

---

## Development setup

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.12+
- pip

### Install dependencies

```bash
pip install -e .[dev]
```

### Run tests

```bash
pytest -q
```

See the full [Development Guide](docs/documentation/04-development-guide.md) for architecture details and more test commands.

---

## Making changes

1. Fork the repository and create a branch from `main`.
2. Make your changes with accompanying tests.
3. Run the full test suite: `pytest -q`
4. Run lint, type check, and spell check (see below).
5. Open a pull request against `main`.

---

## Code style

- **Ruff** enforces linting and formatting — configuration in `pyproject.toml`.
- **Pyright** enforces type safety — configuration in `pyrightconfig.json`.
- Use named constants from `const.py` instead of magic numbers or strings.
- Every function and class must have a docstring describing its observable behavior.
- Test docstrings describe user/system behavior, not internal implementation details.
- Remove dead code (commented-out blocks, unused imports) before opening a PR.

---

## Running CI checks locally

All CI checks run automatically on every PR. You can run them locally before pushing:

```bash
# Linting
ruff check .

# Type checking
pyright

# Spell checking
pip install codespell
codespell

# Secret scanning (requires gitleaks installed separately)
gitleaks detect --source . --config .gitleaks.toml
```

---

## Pull request guidelines

- Keep PRs focused: one logical change per PR.
- Link any related issues in the PR description.
- Fill in the pull request template fully.
- All CI checks must pass before a PR can be merged.
- PRs that introduce new behavior must include tests.

---

## Documentation contributions

- User-facing docs go under `docs/documentation/`.
- Documentation-only PRs do not need new tests, but spell check must pass.
